# ember-vagrant
Vagrant configuration to get started writing Ember apps.

Explanation in my [blog](http://blog.jvtrigueros.com/2015/07/19/ember-cli-development-in-windows/).

## Getting Started

```
git clone https://github.com/jvtrigueros/ember-vagrant.git
cd ember-vagrant
vagrant init
vagrant up
vagrant ssh
```

## TODO

- Use better provisioning other than shell scripts, it doesn't enforce state.
